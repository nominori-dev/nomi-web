This is my personal website to practice React.JS and Next.JS skills.


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nominori-dev/nomi-web
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd nomi-web
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the development server

```bash
  npm run dev
```


## Deployment

Before running production Next.JS server you need to build project.

I'm personally recommend to use yarn package manager.

* Install dependencies
```bash
    yarn install
```

* Build project

```bash
    yarn run build
```

* Run Next.JS Server

```bash
    yarn run start
```

⚠️: **This project does not support `next export` feature**.
